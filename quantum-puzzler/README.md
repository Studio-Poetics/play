# Quantum Puzzler 🎮

A sophisticated puzzle game that explores quantum mechanics through interactive gameplay. Navigate through quantum dimensions, master superposition, and solve increasingly complex puzzles across 15 challenging levels.

## 🎯 Game Overview

**Quantum Puzzler** combines classic puzzle mechanics with quantum physics concepts to create a unique gaming experience. Players control a wireframe avatar that can shift between parallel dimensions (Alpha and Beta), each containing different platforms, obstacles, and mechanics.

## 🎮 Controls

### Basic Movement
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move your quantum avatar
- **SPACE**: Shift between Alpha and Beta dimensions
- **R**: Reset current level to starting position

### Advanced Quantum Mechanics
- **Q**: Enter quantum superposition (see both dimensions simultaneously)
- **Z** or **U**: Undo last move (limited by difficulty mode)
- **H** or **?**: Get current puzzle state description (accessibility)

### Difficulty Mode Selection
- **1**: Casual Mode (10 undos, 5-second superposition)
- **2**: Normal Mode (3 undos, 3-second superposition) - Default
- **3**: Challenge Mode (1 undo, 1.5-second superposition)
- **4**: Zen Mode (unlimited undos and time)

### Touch Controls (Mobile)
- **Swipe**: Move in swiped direction
- **Double-tap**: Shift dimensions
- **Tap and hold**: Enter superposition

## 🧩 Game Elements

### Core Elements
| Element | Visual | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Platforms** | 🔷 Cyan/Magenta wireframes | Walkable surfaces in each dimension |
| **Goal** | 🎯 Pulsing circles | Reach to complete the level |
| **Player** | ⬜ White wireframe cube | Your quantum avatar |

### Interactive Elements
| Element | Visual | Function |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Portals** | 🟡 Yellow pulsing circles | Instant teleportation between locations |
| **Gates** | 🔴🟢 Red (closed) / Green (open) | Barriers controlled by switches |
| **Switches** | 🟠 Orange double circles | Toggle gates on/off |
| **Quantum Locks** | 🔒 Red lock symbols | Require specific dimension-shift sequences |
| **Phase Shifters** | 📐 Colored squares | Only accessible in matching dimension |
| **Mirrors** | 🪞 Silver lines | Reflect position to opposite dimension |

## ⚛️ Quantum Mechanics

### Dimension Shifting
- **Alpha Dimension**: Cyan-colored elements
- **Beta Dimension**: Magenta-colored elements
- Each dimension has different platform layouts and element positions

### Superposition
- Press **Q** to enter superposition state
- See ghostly outline of player in opposite dimension
- Time-limited based on difficulty mode
- Automatically collapses when you move

### Entanglement
- Switches affect gates in both dimensions simultaneously
- Quantum locks progress in both dimensions
- Some actions have cross-dimensional effects

### Decoherence
- Shifting to an invalid position (no platform) triggers decoherence
- Player is reset to level starting position
- Visual and audio feedback indicates the quantum failure

## 🏆 Achievement System

### Available Achievements
- **Speed Runner** 🏃: Complete any level in 5 moves or less
- **Dimension Master** 🌌: Use 10+ dimension shifts in a single level

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### For Beginners
1. **Use Superposition**: Press Q to see both dimensions before moving
2. **Plan Your Route**: Study both dimensions to find the optimal path
3. **Don't Rush**: Take time to understand each new mechanic
4. **Use Undos**: Experiment freely with the Z key

### For Advanced Players
1. **Mirror Mathematics**: Position + Mirror×2 - YourPosition = NewPosition
2. **Lock Sequences**: Memorize common patterns (0=Alpha, 1=Beta)
3. **Phase Timing**: Plan dimension shifts around phase shifter states
4. **Entanglement Strategy**: Use cross-dimensional effects efficiently

### Speedrun Tips
1. **Minimize Shifts**: Each dimension change costs time
2. **Direct Paths**: Avoid unnecessary movements
3. **Portal Routes**: Use teleportation for efficiency
